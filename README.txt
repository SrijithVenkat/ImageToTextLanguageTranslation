Google Vision and Translate API 
- Google translate image-to-text mimic
- This project this is used to translate from text from an Image (Detected Automatically) to language of your Choice
- Supports 122 languages, as that many language code are provided. Google Translate by itself covers 133
- You need to pip install google-cloud-vision, google-cloud-translate before running
- I also left a few test files to play around with if you want too (These are also just random photos on the internet.)
